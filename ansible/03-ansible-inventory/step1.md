By default, Ansible will read `/etc/ansible/hosts` as its default inventory file. Using this file is not recommended though. You should maintain a different inventory file for each project that you have and pass it to both the `ansible` and `ansible-playbook` commands using the `–i` option.

Here is an example of passing a custom inventory file to `ansible` before running the `ping` module:

```
ansible all –i /path/to/inventory –m ping
```

You can run that command yourself, but first you gotta create an inventory file. In this tutorial you have access to one host named `host01`. To let Ansible know about it, put its hostname in an inventory file.

1\. We'll call our inventory file `myhosts`, and you'll add one group called `group1`:

`echo "[group1]" > myhosts`{{execute}}

2\. Then, add the host to the group, while also passing the username to use for SSH access, as an inventory parameter.

`echo "host01 ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu" >> myhosts`{{execute}}

3\. You can obviously look at the editor, but of course, you can also use your terminal to verify that `myhosts` has been modified correctly, also:

`cat myhosts`{{execute}}

So, now we can move on to running that command!
