## Introduction
Welcome to your second lab and your first glance at Ansible Playbooks!

In the previous lab you learned how to connect your host, to a targeted host machine. Now, you'll start off from a host, install Ansible on it, and execute commands on the localhost. The difference is you'll be running your commands from a playbook, using the `ansible-playbook` command.

##### Understanding the Development Environment
This is built on an Ubuntu 14.04 base instance, so this is Linux. There is nothing currently installed, but the essentials, which we've installed already for you. You'll have a terminal and an editor window, just like in the previous lab. Your commands and editor update automatically, but you can interact with them both and make changes manually.

##### Installing Ansible
Your first job will be to install Ansible on the host machine. Before, we used container technology to setup a container where Ansible was already installed, this time you'll learn what it takes to install Ansible on a Linux host machine.

##### Bare Essentials Playbook
You can't learn about Ansible without learning about playbooks! In this lab you'll get your first taste of running commands with Ansible that are predefined in a `playbook.yml` file. This is one of Ansible's most powerful components and should be given careful consideration. You'll start with learning what the playbook is in its simplest form and testing out a common module.

##### Installation Additions
You will then be installing some additions. Most projects require multiple components and in this lab, you will introduce multiple services, such as: Nginx, MySQL, and PHP to your instance. This is still just the tip of the iceberg, but you'll get a feel basic installations and configurations done through a playbook.

##### Playbook Simplification
Part of building smart playbooks, is learning how to simplify them. In the final step in this lab, you'll learn basic ways to simplify playbooks, using some of the tried and true methods of Asnsible developers.

So, let's get this ball rolling! Click on "Start Scenario" to get started learning about Ansible Playbooks. Take your time, have fun, and learn something. Be sure to ask questions, if you have them!
