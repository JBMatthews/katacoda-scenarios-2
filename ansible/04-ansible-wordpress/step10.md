## WordPress Install Configuration

1\. The first thing that youâ€™ll need to do is to extract `wordpress.zip`. Ansible ships with a module named unarchive that knows how to extract several different archive formats:

<pre class="file" data-filename="playbook.yml"><blockquote>
    - name: Unzip WordPress
      unarchive: src=files/wordpress.zip dest=/tmp copy=no creates=/tmp/wordpress/wp-settings.php
</blockquote></pre>

2\. Remember from the lecture, unzip doesn't come installed, so copy and paste this to your playbook **before you install PHP** to make sure it is installed, before it's needed:

```
    - name: Install required tools
      apt: name={{item}} state=present
      with_items:
        - unzip
```

3\. You will also need to add a `creates` argument so that the command is idempotent:

<pre class="file" data-filename="playbook.yml"><blockquote>
    - name: Create project folder
      file: dest=/var/www/book.example.com state=directory
    - name: Copy WordPress files
      command: cp -a /tmp/wordpress/. /var/www/book.example.com creates=/var/www/book.example.com/wp-settings.php
</blockquote></pre>

4\. Once this has run, visit http://book.example.com in your web browser; you should see a WordPress installation screen.
