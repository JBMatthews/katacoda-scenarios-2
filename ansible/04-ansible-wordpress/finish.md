## Conclusion

At this point, you could destroy your environment and spin it up and everything would be the same. Pending a successful install, just like you saw in Ansible Inventory, Ansible's objective is to establish desired stated and keep it that way.  

If you'd like you can test this yourself, if there's time. Ansible will run and automatically provision your WordPress install for you. It may take a few minutes, as itâ€™s installing all of your dependencies as well as configuring WordPress, but it will work. The great thing is, of course, all your information will still be available.

> Next: Congratulations! You have completed the Ansible section. See your instructor for instruction. Also, feel free to go back and re-do any of the scenarios you've previously completely.
