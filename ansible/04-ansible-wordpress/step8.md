## Handler and Configuration Testing

After running Ansible, your new config should rollout and Nginx should be restarted.

1\. To test this, include the IP address and domain that youâ€™ve been using to the bottom of the `/etc/hosts` file, on your host machine:

<pre class="file" data-filename="/etc/hosts"><blockquote>
"hostIP" book.example.com
</blockquote></pre>


2\. Once you've added that, run the following commands to create the appropriate folder:

`sudo mkdir -p /var/www/book.example.com`{{execute}}

3\. Then, run the following to formulate the test display:

`echo "<?php echo date('H:i:s'); " | sudo tee /var/www/book.example.com/index.php`{{execute}}

4\. You should now verify that, the command was successful in copying to the file.

`cat /var/www/book.example.com/index.php`{{execute}}

5\. Finally, ping `http://book.example.com` in your terminal, using curl. You should see the current time:

`curl http://book.example.com`{{execute}}

Now, that is pretty cool, huh?

>Note: If you've come to this point and you've been unable to render the appropriate results, don't worry! It happens to the best of us. Go back to your `default` Nginx folder and check for syntax errors. Also, check the indentation of code in your playbook. You'll get it!
