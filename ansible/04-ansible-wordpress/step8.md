## Handler and Configuration Testing

After running vagrant up, your new config should rollout and nginx should be restarted.

1\. To test this, include the IP address and domain that youâ€™ve been using to the bottom of the `/etc/hosts` file, on your host machine (not your VM):

```yaml
192.168.33.20 book.example.com
```

2\. Now, as before, log in to the virtual machine with `vagrant ssh`.

3\. Once you've successfully logged in, run the following commands to formulate the test display:

```console
# sudo mkdir -p /var/www/book.example.com
# echo "<?php echo date('H:i:s'); " | sudo tee /var/www/book.example.com/index.php
```

4\. Always remember to exit out of your instances, before running further commands!

```
# exit
```

5\. Finally, visit `http://book.example.com` in your browser. You should see the current time.

Now, that is pretty cool, huh? I hope you're proud of yourself.
