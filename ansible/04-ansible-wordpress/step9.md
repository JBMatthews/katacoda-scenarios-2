We learned in the lecture that we face a unquie challenge here. Nginx needs to be restarted in order to pick-up changes, but we don't want Nignx to restart everytime we run our playbook. The best way to "handle" things that need to be restarted, only when things change, is to use a *handler*. 

#### Handler Configuration

Add the following lines of code to your playbook, putting them on the same level and indentation as `tasks`:

```yml
handlers:
    - name: restart nginx
      service: name=nginx state=restarted
```

You can trigger it whenever your `config` file changes, by updating the "Create nginx config" task, to look like this:

```yaml
<pre>
- name: Create nginx config
  template: src=templates/nginx/default dest=/etc/nginx/sites-available/default
  <b>notify: restart nginx</b>
</pre>
```

Be sure to save it! But, this feels like a good opportunity to run `vagrant destroy`, followed by `vagrant up` to confirm that everything is installed and configured correctly.

#### Handler and Configuration Testing

After running vagrant up, your new config should rollout and nginx should be restarted.

To test this, include the IP address and domain that youâ€™ve been using to the bottom of the `/etc/hosts` file, on your host machine (not your VM):

```console
[your ip] book.example.com
```

Now, as before, log in to the virtual machine with `vagrant ssh`.

Once you've successfully logged in, run the following commands to formulate the test display:

`sudo mkdir -p /var/www/book.example.com
echo "<?php echo date('H:i:s'); " | sudo tee /var/www/book.example.com/index.php'{{execute}}

Always remember to exit out of your instances, before running further commands!

```
# exit
```

Finally, visit `http://book.example.com` in your browser. You should see the current time.

Now, that is pretty cool, huh? I hope you're proud of yourself
