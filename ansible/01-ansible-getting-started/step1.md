To make our lives easier later, let us define the commands "a" and "t" for quickly connecting from the base system to the ansible and target container:

1\. Connect to the Ansible container:

`a() { docker exec -it ansible bash -c "echo 'PS1='\''ansible# '\' >> /root/.bashrc; bash"; } `{{execute HOST1}}

2\. Connect to the Target container:

`t() {  docker exec -it target bash -c "echo 'PS1='\''target# '\' >> /root/.bashrc; bash";  } `{{execute HOST1}}

In this tutorial, we already have started an ansible and a target container in the background. However, they have been started in the background, and they need some time to become available.

3\. Repeat using a docker ps command to check, whether Docker containers named 'ansible' and 'target' have been started already:

`docker ps`{{execute HOST1}}

Repeat sending the command until it looks similar to the following:

<pre>
CONTAINER ID      IMAGE                                   COMMAND                 CREATED         STATUS        PORTS NAMES
c96e3a45e164      ubuntu:14.04                            "/bin/bash -c 'whi..."  11 seconds ago  Up 9 seconds  target
caf61a258abb      virtuant/ansible-host-node:lte    "/bin/bash -c 'whi..."  13 seconds ago  Up 11 seconds ansible
</pre>

This should take no longer than 30 sec. Continue to run `docker ps` to verify.

> Note: Do NOT move on until you have verified your Ansible and Target containers are running.
