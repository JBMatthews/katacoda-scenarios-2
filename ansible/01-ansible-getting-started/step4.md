In order to be able to connect from the Ansible container to the target container, we need to create a private + public SSH key pair on Ansible and copy the public key to the target machine.

1\. For that, let us exit from the target container

`exit`{{execute HOST1}}

2\. Now, enter the ansible container again.

`a`{{execute HOST1}}

3\. On the ansible system, let us generate a SSH key pair like follows:
`ssh-keygen -t rsa`{{execute HOST1}}

Just keep the defaults, click into the Terminal and press return three times.

4\. This will generate ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and ~/.ssh/id_rsa on the ~/.ssh directory:

`ls -ltr ~/.ssh`{{execute HOST1}}
