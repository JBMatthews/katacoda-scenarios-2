1\. Now, since the target knows about the Ansible host's public SSH key, we are ready to connect from the Ansible host to our target:

`exit`{{execute HOST1}}

2\. Back to Ansible's host machine:

`a`{{execute HOST1}}

3\. Now we test the connection, that had failed previously:

`ansible all -i 'target,' -m ping`{{execute HOST1}}

This time we get following output:

<pre>
<span style="color: green">

target | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

</span>
</pre>
